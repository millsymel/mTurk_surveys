HTML surveys for MTURK

This repository contains HTML coded surveys catered to mTurk. 
The goal was to build basic survey functionalities. 
The most recent example includes mutiple choice radio buttons and a crowd slider to measure/rank preferences

As new surveys are written I'll continue to add them to this repository
